# README

This is a maven module that will run ansible-lint against a configurable directory.

## Ansible Lint

Ansible Lint is a command line tool for ansible that will verify the following:
  - valid yaml 
  - valid ansible syntax
  - ansible best practices

For more information see the [Ansible Site][ansible-lint-site].

## Requirements

Ansible Lint must be installed on the machine running the maven execution.  This can be done on Windows by enabling the Windows Linux Subsytem.  See the [Ansible Lint Installation][ansible-lint-installation] for more details.
